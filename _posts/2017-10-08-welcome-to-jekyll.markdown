Hi there! Welcome to my blog.

I'm mainly going to use this space to write things about web development in order for me to not forget about things that I've learnt.

There's something reinforcing about writing that helps me retain information.

My posts aren't going to be super polished or tutorial-like &ndash; it's just me kind of like doodling and talking to myself.

:)
